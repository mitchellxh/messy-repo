Project Notes - January 2023
============================

Current tasks:
- Clean up data files
- Organize notebooks  
- Update analysis scripts
- Fix broken file paths

Issues to resolve:
- Multiple versions of customer data
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Missing documentation
- Scattered files across directories

Files that need attention:
✓ sales_data.csv - looks good
? customer_data_processed-v3.csv - check format  
✗ old analysis notebooks - may be outdated
✓ sensor data - recently updated

Ideas for improvement:
1. Create standard directory structure
2. Implement file naming conventions
3. Add proper documentation
4. Set up automated testing
5. Create data validation scripts

Meeting notes from last week:
- Team agreed on new organization structure
- Need to migrate old files gradually
- Keep backups of everything
- Update all documentation

Random thoughts:
- Should we use a different tool for analysis?
- Consider cloud storage for large datasets
- Maybe implement version control for data files
- Need better backup strategy
